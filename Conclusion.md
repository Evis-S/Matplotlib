### Analysis
In our case we need to analyze if we have any connection or correlation between the weight of the mouse and the average volume of the tumor.
We have 248 mice of which 51% are male and 49% female, which are in 10 types of drug regimes.
Capomulin    230
Ramicane     228
Ketapril     188
Naftisol     186
Zoniferol    182
Placebo      181
Stelasyn     181
Infubinol    178
Ceftamin     178
Propriva     148

For this study, Regress helps us.

*First, we need to find the correlation coefficient to see if we have a correlation or not.
In our case, the correlation coefficient is 0.84. This coefficient shows that we are dealing with a strong correlation.
So the weight of the mouse affects the average volume of the tumor. This means that as the weight of the mouse increases, the average tumor volume tends to increase as well.
However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation, may be other factors influencing mouse weight and tumor volume, or the association may be due to chance.
*Second we need to find r-squared.
In our study, the r-squared value is 0.709 which means that approximately 71% of the variation in tumor volume can be explained by the variation in mouse weight. This means that mouse weight is a fairly good predictor of mean tumor volume in this context.
But we also have and 29% of the variation in tumor volume is not explained by mouse weight and may be influenced by other factors. 
*The regression line y = 0.95x + 21.55 represents a linear relationship between the two variables, where y represents the predicted value of average tumor volume and x represents the value of mouse weight.According to this equation, for every one-unit increase in mouse weight (x), the predicted average tumor volume (y) increases by 0.95 units. 
Additionally, as with any statistical analysis, it is important to consider the sample size, potential confounding variables, and other limitations of the study design when interpreting the results.
